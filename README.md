# Device installation scripts for MacOS

This repository houses some of the set up scripts that I use to get a new MacOS up-and-running.

- Mac Setup Folder 
  - script to brew install applications
  
# Install apps and binaries with Brew
source mac/brew-essentials.sh
```

- VSCode Folder 
  - Contains VSCode settings.json
```
